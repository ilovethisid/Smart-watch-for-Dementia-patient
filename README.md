### To prevent dememtia patient from getting lost, our system can tracking with a warning if the patient gets far away. Our system consists of three components, which are watch, server, and smartphone application. Watch tracks dementia patient with its GPS feature and sends them to server. Server connects the watch and smartphone application. Smartphone warns caregivers if the patient gets far from home. A warning message is sent to the watch as well, to warn the patient. Then, the patient can find their way back home by watchâ€™s navigation system.
